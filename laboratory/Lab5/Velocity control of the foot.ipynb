    "## End-effector velocities\n",
    "\n",
    "Last laboratory, we used analytic IK to compute desired positions for the joint angles that would ensure we reach a desired position (touching the pink balls). Then we generated a straight line trajectory in joint space and used the joint PD controller to track this trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will use the fact that $$\\mathcal{V}_{SO}^O = J_O(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\cdot \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$$ \n",
    "to derive directly a controller acting in the foot space. \n",
    "Here $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [\\theta_0, \\theta_1, \\theta_2]$ is the vector containing all the joint positions.\n",
    "We will generate directly generate trajectories for the foot and follow them without ever explicitly computing the inverse kinematics of the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only look at the linear velocity of point O (i.e. the velocity of the foot with respect to the spatial frame), we can decompose the Jacobian into two part (the top 3 rows are associated to the angular velocity of the foot and the bottom 3 are associated to the linear velocity): $$J_O(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\begin{bmatrix} J_{O\\omega} \\\\ J_{Ov} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "and we can write the velocity equation as\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{V}_{SO}^O = \\begin{pmatrix} \\omega_O \\\\ v_O \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} J_{O\\omega} \\\\ J_{Ov} \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So the linear velocity of the foot is $$v_O = J_{Ov} \\dot{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our robot have 3 joints, away from singular configurations, the matrix $J_{Ov}$ (which is 3x3) will be invertible. It means that the joint velocity that achieves a desired foot velocity is\n",

    "\n",
    "## End-effector control\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a desired velocity we would like to achieve for the foot, we can then directly convert it into a desired velocity for the joints. Then we could use our joint PD controller where we would remove the P part to track this joint space velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume we have a reference foot trajectory (e.g. coming from our trajectory generator that create smooth trajectories from a starting point to a desired goal with 0 velocities and accelerations at the beginning and end of the trajectories). At each instant of time, we then get $x_{ref}$ and $\\dot{x}_{ref}$, the desired position and velocity of the foot. Our desired foot velocity (which is different from the target) could then be a combination between the reference velocity and an error correction term to make sure we stay on the trajectory\n",
    "$$v_O = \\dot{x}_{ref} + P (x_{ref} - x_{measured})$$\n",

    "## Dealing with singularities (very important!!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jacobian becomes singular, i.e. non invertible, when $\\theta_2 = 0$. In this case, our control law will not be well defined because the Jacobian cannot be inverted (we will see in class how to deal with this situation too later).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, there are 2 simple ways to handle this situation:\n",
    "1. make sure the robot never reaches a singular configuration, whenever $|\\theta_2| < 0.05$ stop everything,\n",
    "or,\n",
    "2. when $|\\theta_2| < 0.05$ (i.e. we are close to a singularity), we can change the matrix to inverse to make it invertible by replacing $J_{Ov}^{-1}$ by $(J_{Ov} + \\epsilon I)^{-1}$ where $\\epsilon$ is a small number, e.g. 10e-4.\n",

    "## Questions: goal-reaching\n",
    "1. Write a resolved-rate controller that solves the goal-reaching tasks from Lab 3 and 4 - generate end-effector trajectories using a 5th order polynomial as in Lab 4.\n",
    "2. Compare the results with the results from Lab 4 - how does the end-effector trajectory change? Plot the measured end-effector position and velocity of the foot and the reference ones. The quantities should be graphed vs. time (use the Jacobian to get the measured end-effector velocities)\n",
    "3. Run the experiment on the real robot and analysize the results.\n",
